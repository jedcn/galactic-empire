## Topic: Start playing Galactic Empire

When you begin playing Galactic Empire you are first given an
Interceptor class ship. The Interceptor is ideal to begin your quest
into the Galaxy.  You can seek out an ideal planet to colonize, claim
it, and transport down a basic compliment of colonists and supplies.

After starting your colony give it some time to grow. Your planet
will soon be large enough to generate taxes and cash in your
pocket. With this cash you can purchase larger and larger ship
and expand your empire.

Beware the Cybertrons, they are bent on destroying all human life in the
Galaxy and are tough (but not impossible) to beat. Cybertrons may be
vicious, but they do have a code; they will not attack an Interceptor or
Freighter unless provoked.

Good Luck and enjoy the game.

Further hints are available under other help topics.

## Topic: Galaxy

The game takes place in a universe with millions of sectors and thousands
of known planets. Each sector is 10000 by 10000 parsecs square. The entire
navigable galaxy is 6000 by 6000 sectors numbered from the center of
the galaxy to the edges. Sectors are mapped on a two coordinate system
giving a galactic map that looks something like this;

       +--------------------------------------+
       |-3000,-3000                +3000,-3000|
       |                                      |
       |                                      |
       |                                      |
       |                                      |

       |                                      |
       |                                      |
       |                                      |
       |                                      |
       |                                      |
       |-3000,+3000                +3000,+3000|
       +--------------------------------------+

Each sector is measured 10000 by 10000 parsecs square measured from the
top left to bottom right as follows;

       +--------------------------------------+
       |0,0                             0,9999|
       |                                      |

       |9999,0                       9999,9999|
       +--------------------------------------+

## Topic: Sector

In each sector there may be between 0 and 9 planetary bodies. Each
planet has various environmental and resource qualities. The best
planet has very good resources and a very good environment.

Sector 0 0 is governed by the Galactic Command and is a declared neutral
zone. This policy is maintained by the Enforcer Planet. A single
hostile action by any player in this sector will be met with a swift and
preemptive strike from the Galactic Commands top secret weapons base on
The Enforcer Planet.

Sector 0 0 also has the first planet Zygor, the leaders in state-
of-the-art weapons and ship hardware. Zygor manufactures the various ships
and the weapons they carry. It is also home of the Galactic Monetary
Reserve Fund, the only duly authorized financial institution in the
Galaxy.

Planet number two in Sector 0 0 is Tahanian Station, a embarking station
for colonists and mercenary soldiers. This is also where you can purchase
food supplies.

Once out of Sector 0 0 it is a free for all, and you have to decide how to
best defend yourself and your planets.

## Topic: Communications

Each ship has a communications console with three separate
transmission channels. You can set each to a specific channel or to
the HAIL setting which permits you to receive all general hailing
messages. If you create alliances you can set one radio to an agreed
upon channel and have a private and secure communications path
between members of your alliance.

Use the FREQ command to change the communications frequency.

Note that if the frequency is set above 32000 then it is determined to be
a Hyperspace communications Packet Code and transmissions will be sent
via Hyperspace to anyone with the same packet code anywhere in the Galaxy.

## Topic: Moving (Navigating)

All directional information in Galactic Empire functions on a 360 degree
compass and is strictly two dimensional. The major bearings are illustrated
as follow;

       315  0  45
          \ | /
           \|/
     270----*----90
           /|\
          / | \
       225 180 135

BEARING - Bearing is always used to indicate where a particular ship
or planet is in relation to you. It is relative to the direction you
are facing and expressed in a number from -180 to +180. If a object
is bearing -90, it is to the left of you, if +90 it is to the right
of you, if 0 it is directly in front of you, and if - or + 180 it is
directly behind you.

HEADING - Heading is the relative direction of the other ship. It is
used to indicate when a ship is facing toward or away from you. A
heading of 0 means the ship is facing toward you, while a heading of
180 is away from you.

GALACTIC HEADING - This is the absolute heading in the galaxy. A galactic
heading of 0 means you (or the other ship) is facing north up.

## Topic: Owning Planets

In order to build up wealth you must colonize planets and maintain
them.  Planets are claimed by simply going into orbit around one and
using the ADMIN command. You should be choosy at first about which
planets you put a population on, as surviving on a poor planet can be
very difficult and require frequent supply runs.

Planets are rated on two factors, resources, and environment, with
the following categories, POOR, MARGINAL, GOOD, and VERY GOOD. The
resources factor rates the natural resources of the planet. A rating
of good or very good will insure that your population has plenty of
natural resources to use in the establishment of the colony, and the
manufacture of goods. The environment factor rates the hospitality of
the planet and how difficult it will be for a colony to survive.  A
rating of good, or very good, will insure that the majority of there
efforts go toward producing goods and not simply surviving.

Once you have claimed a planet you need to establish a population on
it. This is done with the TRANSFER command to shuttle items from your
ship to the planet. Once a colony is established they become an
somewhat independent society. Anything you transfer to the planet
belongs to them, you cannot transfer it back. If you wish to retrieve
items from a planet you must purchase them from the planet at the
base price.

Type HELP PLANETS2 for more information on planets

## Topic: Owning planets (Section 2)

It is a good idea to leave some additional items on a planet besides
men. They are;

FOOD - If you fail to leave food on the planet you will find your men
and troops all dead when you return next time. It is a good idea to
leave a case for each 10 men & troops you have.

TROOPS - Troops are mercenaries who produce nothing but serve to
defend your planet from outside attacks and prevent domestic revolts.
They must be fed well, and will fight to the death when attacked.

FIGHTERS - Fighters will defend your planet from both ground troop
invasions and fighter attacks. They provide a primary defense force
for your planet.  Your troops will not be called into action unless
the fighters are all destroyed.

ION CANNON - This is a large defensive cannon which will attack any
hostile ship that is in orbit around your planet. It will fire once
every few seconds, and can destroy a ship in just a few blasts.  An
attacking ship won't stay long with an ion cannon firing upon them.
You can have multiple ion cannons, but only one will be active at a
time.

Type HELP PLANETS3 for more information on Planets

## Topic: Owning planets (Section 3)

There are several other factors you may adjust when you establish a
planet.  When the planet is first established your colony is
instructed to divide their efforts evenly between the manufacture of
each of the commodities a planet can produce. You may wish to alter
this to provide for faster population growth, and food production.
Additionally, you can tax your planet at a specific rate. The harsher
the tax the less the productivity. Tax is your principle source of
income for purchasing supplies for your ship.  This tax is kept in
the planetary bank until you arrive to collect it.

Your colony will produce all the supplies you need for your ship if
managed properly. These goods are cheapest at your own planets as
Zygor charges three times the base rate for goods. The cash you
spend on supplies goes into the planetary bank and is used to
purchase more raw materials when the Galactic Command supply ships
come around.

You can decide to sell supplies to other players if you like, and even
mark up the price to other players. If you wish to be selective in
who can purchase from your planets you can establish a trade password
for your planet and only those who know the password can buy from
you.  This is also useful in establishing an alliance with other
players where you all would set your planets to the same password and
agree on the price to charge each other.  Non-members will be
excluded from trading with your alliance.

Remember that the better your planet, the more attractive it is to
marauders.  Nothing can take the place of a well rounded defense
system and frequent supply runs. Leaving a planet un-checked for more
than a few days may spell disaster for your colony.

## Topic: Game Strategy

Your ship is equipped with nothing when you first enter the game, you
are not in any eminent danger as sector 0 0 is a neutral zone. You
are provided with a light freighter and an amount of cash with which
you must decide what you are going to do.

On Zygor you can purchase shield systems, phaser systems, missiles,
torpedoes, fighters, decoys, and ion cannons. Note: some of these may
not be available or useful on some ship classes (see HELP CLASS for
more info).

On Tahanian Station you can purchase colonists (men), troops, and
food. Your first goal should be to secure an income for yourself, and
therefore provide a source for taxes you will need to expand your
empire, and keep your ships fully stocked.  To do this you should
purchase men, troops, food, and some fighters.  Locate as good a
planet as you can find and colonize it. It is advisable that you
steer clear of other ships unless you know they are friendly.

An alternative, albeit somewhat immoral, strategy is to purchase
weapons and lie waiting for other ships to leave sector 0 0. When
they do mount an attack and upon destroying their ship, gain what
remains of the supplies on their ship. After several successful
attacks you may have enough to colonize a planet or two.

When you do colonize a planet you should redirect the majority of the
effort to producing men, food, and troops, and gaining cash with
which you can purchase larger and more powerful ships and expand your
empire.

Remember, these are only a couple suggested strategies, and others are
only limited by your imagination.

## Topic: Battle Strategy

The flexibility of Galactic Empire precludes an exhaustive discussion
of all the strategies involved in user versus user battling. Some
suggestions are simply put forth here to get you started.

When in a potential battle situation make sure your shields are up,
and keep moving. The easiest target is a ship with shields down,
sitting still.

If you have a cloaking system use it sparingly as it consumes
incredible amounts of energy, it is most useful in covering a
retreat.

If you have incoming torpedoes you can ditch them easily by making a
jump to light speed provided you have warp drive.  This does not work
for missiles though as they too can go hyperspace.

Launching decoys does not guarantee that the incoming missiles or
torpedoes will be destroyed. Launching more decoys than incoming
weapons increases the chance of destroying an incoming weapon.

When launching an attack try to get close to the target and use the
faster torpedoes as they will have less time to react.

Type HELP BATTLE2 for more information on battling

## Topic: Battle Strategy (Section 2)

If a target goes to light speed be prepared to make the jump with him
and use Hyper-Phasers as soon as you pass warp 1.

If you get hit with a Hyper-Phaser immediately go into a series of 180
degree high speed turns as your opponent will have difficulty
locating you. Go out of light speed in another sector and immediately
cloak as a last ditch effort to loose your pursuers.

Form alliances to help protect each other from marauders. Remember two
ships are twice as powerful as one.

When you are under attack you cannot EXIT the game to avoid your
attackers.  If you hang-up while you are under attack your ship will
be destroyed.  Remember "Death before Dishonor"!!

If you are damaged try to make it back to sector 0 0 or to one of your
own planets where you can get your ship repaired with the MAINT
command. Remember the cost for everything is much more expensive in
Sector 0 0.

When you kill another ship you will get some of his goods on his ship.
This can be very helpful when you are running low.

Type HELP BATTLE3 for more information on battling

## Topic: Battle Strategy (section 3) Planetary Battles.....

Planets can defend themselves with troops, fighters, and ion cannons.
If you have no troops or fighters then your planet can be easily
overrun.

FIGHTERS are Nova Class Battle Fighters commanded by a fully
automated tactical computer. They have inboard and outboard photon
cannons capable of powerful and deadly offensive and defensive
attacks. When pitted against troops the fighter is deadly, capable of
taking out between 10 and 50 troops in a pass. When pitted against
other fighters they are fairly evenly matched.

TROOPS are trained mercenaries, and serve no other function than the
defense or attack on a planet. The consume food, maintain there
skills, and mostly play cards. But when needed they will fight to the
death.

ION CANNONS are the very powerful fixed focus, ion-plasma
transmitters, capable of taking out a Star Class ship with only a few
strikes. They are strictly defensive weapons controlled by a fully
automated system.  When the planet comes under attack they will
automatically locate the attacker and commence firing upon the ship.

When attacking a planet you are always at a disadvantage, as the local
troops and fighters are better supported and fresh. Knowing this you
should always plan on commencing a battle with superior numbers.

Begin with a fighter attack. If they have no fighters you will
overpower the troops rather quickly. If they have fighters you will
be in a better position to do battle.

After each wave your fighters or troops will return to your ship. If
you wish to send them back you can do so. Remember, you will not take
a planet so long as 1 fighter or 1 squad of troops (5) exists on the
planet.

## Topic: Cyborgs and Cybertrons

Cyborgs are a race of automatons which are bent on the destruction of
all humans from the universe. They command a class of ship manufactured
specifically for them, the Cybertron. Both pilot and ship function as a
single fighting unit and they can be quite deadly.

The Cybertron is armed with phasers, and torpedoes, but has no missile
capability. They can be deadly in hyperspace with hyper-phasers, but
cannot recycle the phaser as fast as most other ships. Cybertrons are
prone to battle failure, and they will malfunction occasionally. This
is often noted by strange transmissions from their ship.

The top speed of a Cybertron is warp 8.0 so they can be out run with a
faster ship. They will however continue seeking, and if you stay too
long in a single spot, they will catch up. The larger the ship the
more cybertrons that will be dispatched to intercept it. It is not
advisable to get caught in a sector with a swarm of cybertrons
surrounding you.

Finally, Cybertrons will not attack smaller ships unless first provoked, so
don't mess with them unless you know what you are doing.


## Topic: Scoring

Scores are based upon the size of your empire and the number and class
of kills you have accumulated is ship to ship combat.  Each class of
ship is worth a different number of points as detailed below;

```
Interceptor       10
Light Freighter   25
Heavy Freighter   75
Destroyer        150
Star Cruiser     200
Battle Cruiser   250
Frigate          300
Dreadnought      500
Cybertron         75
Cyberquad        200
```

Additionally you are awarded as a bonus, a small percentage of the killed
players score on top of the ship points.

Finally, when you kill another player, his score goes also This means
that you can actually knock him down on the top player list making it
easier to overtake him (or pass him further).

## Topic: Wormholes

Wormholes are fairly rare galactic anomalies caused by a paired
spatial singularity. The effect it to create a means of "leaping"
across the galaxy to another sector. To navigate through a wormhole
you must carefully approach it directly at about 1/4 impulse. You
will be pulled into the wormhole and emerge at the terminal sector.
If you approach too fast you will simply miss the event horizon. If
you approach too slow you may oscillate between terminal sectors.
Each time you pass through a wormhole some damage to systems may
occur. Passing through a wormhole while severely damaged is not
recommended. Wormholes are usually by-directional but an even rarer
form of one way wormhole has been speculated to exist.


## Topic: The ADMIN command

The ADMIN command permits you to claim and administer a planet once
in orbit. If you already own this planet then you can perform several
planetary maintenance functions from the Planer Administration Menu.

```
Planet Administration Menu
-----------------------------------
1 - Get accounting report
2 - Collect taxes ($)
3 - Alter work assignments and
    adjust trade policy/pricing
4 - Rename planet
5 - Adjust Tax Rate
6 - Set Trade Password
x - Exit to command mode
```

## Topic: The abandon command
The abandon command will release ownership of a planet previously
claimed. You must be in orbit around the planet to be abandoned.
Issue the abandon command as follows;

```
   abandon
```

simple enough.

## Topic: The Abort command
The Abort command will abort a self distract countdown and prevent
the destruction of your ship.

## Topic: The Attack command
The Attack command permits you to start an attack on a planet with
either troops or fighters. Issue the Attack command as follows;

```
  attack [<number>] [tro/fig]

  number = number of troops or fighters to attack with;

  tro = send <number> troops to the surface.
  fig = send <number> fighters to the surface.

  examples: attack 100 tro
            attack 30 fighters
```

## Topic: The Buy command
The Buy command will permit you to purchase goods from one of your own
planets or another players planet. Issue the Buy command as follows;

```
buy [<number>] [men/tro/mis/tor/ion/flu/foo/fig/dec/min/jam/zip/gol]
               [<password>]

number = the number you want to buy.

  men  = buy men
  tro  = buy troops
  mis  = buy missiles
  tor  = buy torpedoes
  ion  = buy ion cannons
  flu  = buy flux pods
  foo  = buy food
  fig  = buy fighters
  dec  = buy decoys
  min  = buy mines
  jam  = buy jammers
  zip  = buy zippers
  gol  = buy gold

  password = optional trade password may be required by planet.

examples:
  buy 1000 men
  buy 3 ion
  buy 500 foo drowssap
```

## Topic: The Cloak command

The Cloak command will turn on or off the cloaking system, if your
ship is equipped. The cloaking system consumes large amounts of power and
you should be careful not to drain all your energy pool. The cloaking system
takes a few seconds to charge once the command is issued.

Issue the Cloak command as follows;

```
   cloak [ON/OFF]

   Example:  Cloak on
                  Cloak off
```

## Topic: The CLS function

The CLS function simply clears the screen using ANSI characters.

## Topic: The Decoy command
The Decoy command deploys a single decoy. Decoys proceed away from
your ship and send a sensor signature that resembles your ship. If a torpedo
or missile comes near the decoy the decoy will explode and destroy the
inbound weapon. The decoy will self destruct after a period of time to prevent
stray decoys floating around in your navigation path.


## Topic: The Destruct command

The Destruct command will begin a self destruct countdown timer that
when it reaches zero will destroy your ship. The countdown can be aborted with
the ABORT command.


## Topic: The Flux command

The Flux command will replace an exhausted Flux Pod from the energy pool
with a new one. This command presumes that you want it changed now, and does
not warn you if there is still a good percentage of power left in the old pod.
The old pod is jettisoned. Your power is restored to full charge automatically.


## Topic: The Help command

The Help command will display a vast amount of information on
Galactic Empire. Type HELP for a list of subjects.


## Topic: The Hyper-Phaser command

When in hyperspace the normal ships phasers are useless. The
Hyper-Phaser however can be deadly. The Hyper-Phaser Beam is very narrow
but very powerful and can destroy another ship with only a few well placed
shots. Issue the Hyper-Phaser command as follows;

```
   phaser [<direction>]

  direction = the heading to fire the phasers at, usually the same as the
              bearing of another ship given in the "scan sh" command. With
              the Hyper-Phaser you must be pin-point accurate to score a hit.

  examples: phaser 4    fire 4 degrees off starboard.
            phaser 180  fire directly behind you.

  Note: The Fire Control System automatically switches to Hyper-Phasers
        when in hyperspace.
```

## Topic: The Impulse command

The Impulse command directs your impulse (sub-light) engines and
sets your course and speed. Issue the Impulse command as follows;

```
  impulse [<speed>] [<heading>]

  speed   = the impulse speed between 0 and 99 (99 is .99 light speed)
  heading = the heading from your current direction

  examples: impulse 5 0    would alter the speed to impulse 5 and not
                           change the heading.
            impulse 10 5   would alter the speed to impulse 10 and turn the
                           ship 5 degrees to the starboard (right).
            impulse 10 355 would alter the speed to impulse 10 and turn the
                           ship 5 degrees to the port (left).
```

## Topic: The jammer command

The jammer command will cause a jammer device to be launched. It
disrupts all scanner systems on all ships within range of the device, yours
included. It is useful for covering an escape or distracting an opponent.
Issue the jammer command as follows;

```
  jammer
```

Simple enough!


## Topic: The Lock command

The Lock command permits you to lock your fire control systems onto
a specific ship no matter what its letter designation changes to. As long
as the ship is within scanner range the fire control systems will remain
locked onto that specific ship. This is extremely useful when in heated
battle and multiple ships are in the vicinity. Ship letter designated -A-
may become -B- or -C- as other ships move closer to you. The Lock command
permits you to stay locked on to the ship as distances and letter designates
change.

Commands like MISSILE and TORPEDO can be then be used with the Lock option
to fire on the ship you have locked onto. Issue the Lock command as follows;

```
   lock [<ship letter designate>]
   -or-
   lock

   examples: lock A     would lock onto the closest ship.
             lock B     would lock onto the second closest ship.

             lock       would cause the lock to be released.
```

Note: Once a ship is killed the lock is released automatically.


## Topic: The Maintenance command

The Maintenance command functions when you are in orbit at your own
planet or Zygor. The maintenance crews will start repairing your ship and
charge you a nominal fee of 200c's at your own planet and 2500c's at Zygor.

Leaving orbit early will cease all repairs on the ship.

## Topic: The MINE command

The MINE command causes a neutron mine to be deposited at your
current location. You specify how long until detonation permitting you time
to leave the spot for safety. Mines are useful when you are being tailed
by another ship. Beware that they are very powerful and you can also be
damaged by them if you don't get far enough away. Issue the MINE command
as follows;

```
  mine [<time>]

  time = the time till detonation in centocks (approx 5 seconds). This can
         be set from 1 to 50.

  Example:  mine 10    will deposit a mine to detonate in 10 centocks
```

## Topic: The Missile command

The Missile command instructs your ship to fire a hyper-missile at
a given ship with a given charge. This missile guidance system will attempt
to lock on the ship prior to firing the missile. If a lock is made the missile
is launched. Issue the Missile command as follows;

```
  missile [<ship letter>/@] [<energy>]

  ship letter = the ship you are firing upon
  @           = to fire at the locked on ship
  energy      = the energy from your Neutron Flux Pile to charge into
                the missile.

  examples: missile A 100   would fire a missile at ship A which will only
                            cause minor (if any) damage.
            missile C 20000 would fire a missile at ship C which will cause
                            major damage.
            missile @ 10000 would fire on the ship that a previous Lock
                            command has locked on to.

  note: the energy imparted to the missile must come from your charged
        neutron flux pile and will drain the pile by that amount.

## Topic: The Orbit command
The Orbit command instructs your ship to enter into orbit around
a given planet. Issue the Orbit command as follows;

```
  orbit [<planet #>]

  planet # = the planet you are wishing to orbit.

  NOTE: YOU MUST BE 250 or closer to orbit a planet!

  example:  orbit 2
```

## Topic: The Phaser command
The Phaser command directs your ships phasers to fire in a given
direction with a given beam spread. The more narrow the beam the stronger the
hit, but the more difficult it is to get a hit.
Issue the Phaser command as follows;

```
  phaser [<direction>] [<spread>]

  direction = the heading to fire the phasers at, usually the same as the
              bearing of another ship given in the "scan sh" command.
  spread    = the focus of the beam (0 to 5). 0 gives the most concentrated
              beam but is so narrow that you must be dead on to get a hit.
              1 and 2 are good numbers to use if you know where a target is
              located. Use 5 if you know he is close but cloaked.

  examples: phaser 4 1   fire 4 degrees off starboard, focus 1.
            phaser 180 5 fire directly behind focus 5.
```

## Topic: The Planet command

will automatically turn in the direction which causes the shortest arc to
arrive at the given heading. Issue the Rotate command as follows;

```
  rotate [<heading>] or
  rotate [@<abosolute heading>]

  heading = the heading from your current direction
  absolute heading = the abosolute direction regardless of your current
            heading.

  examples: rotate 5   would turn the ship 5 degrees to the starboard (right).
            rotate -5  would turn the ship 5 degrees to the port (left).
            rotate @5  would turn the ship to 5 degrees absolute.
```

## Topic: The SET command
The SET command lets you set user configurable options.

```

  examples: freq A 12345
            freq b hail
            freq c 23221

  note: Channel frequencies above 20000 are converted to hyperspace modulation
           packets and transmitted through hyperspace.
        Channel frequencies below 20000 are transmitted in the current star
           system only.
```

## Topic: The Shield command

The Shield command will raise or lower the ships shields. The shields
will begin charging upon being raised for the first time. They are providing
immediate yet limited protection until fully charged. When fully charged the
shields come up immediately when issued. The shields do drain on the neutron
flux pile, and will automatically come down when the energy drops to
dangerously low levels.

NOTE: When firing a weapon with the shields up, the shields will be
automatically lowered. They WILL NOT be automatically raised after the firing.

```
  shield [up/down]

  examples: shield up    would raise the shields
            shield down  would lower the shields
```

## Topic: The Torpedo command

The Torpedo command instructs your ship to fire a torpedo at a given
ship. This fire control system will attempt to lock on the ship prior to
firing the torpedo. If a lock is made the torpedo is launched. Issue the
Torpedo command as follows;

```
  torpedo [<ship letter>/@]

  ship letter = the ship you are firing upon
  @           = the locked on ship.

  examples: torpedo A   would fire a torpedo at ship A.
            torpedo @   would fire at the ship you locked on with the LOCK cmd
```

## Topic: The Transfer command

The Transfer command permits you to transfer goods from your ship
to a newly established planet, or from a planet to your ship.

has them) and directs your course and speed. Issue the Warp command as follows;

```
warp [<speed>] [<heading>]

speed   = the warp speed between 0 and 50
heading = the heading from your current direction

examples:
warp 5 0    would alter the speed to warp 5 and not
            change the heading.
warp 10 5   would alter the speed to warp 10 and turn the ship
            5 degrees to the starboard (right).
warp 10 355 would alter the speed to warp 10 and turn the ship
            5 degrees to the port (left).
```

## Topic: The ZIP command

The ZIP command launches a defensive (and sometimes offensive) weapon
which interferes with the timing mechanism on mines. The effect is to trip
all mines in the vicinity of the players ship into exploding immediately. This
weapon can be used to "trip" an opponents mines after he has laid them but
before he can distance himself from them, causing the mines to do damage to
the opponents own ship. Issue the zipper command as follows;

```
  zipper
```

Easy enough!
